# Hr-Interview-Analysis

Project Overview
This dashboard provides a comprehensive visualization of employee satisfaction data gathered over two years. The dataset was collected through biannual interviews conducted by interviewers assigned by the HR department of a company. The interviews covered employees from various departments and job roles, distributed across different geographical locations.
The results of these interviews were categorized into three levels of satisfaction:
1.	Happy: Employees who expressed satisfaction with their job.
2.	Unhappy: Employees who expressed dissatisfaction.
3.	Neutral: Employees who provided ambiguous or neutral feedback ("Poker face").
The dashboard aims to assist stakeholders in understanding trends and patterns in employee satisfaction across different categories and locations.
